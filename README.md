# Kanban-Board

A React-based Kanban board built using @hello-pangea/dnd for drag-and-drop functionality. This application allows users to organize tasks into columns like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." The project demonstrates modern React practices, state management, and component-based architecture.
